### **What To Avoid:**
- ❌ Feature lists
- ❌ Technical jargon
- ❌ Overwhelming details
- ❌ Comparisons to other tools

## 🗣️ Talking Points

### **When They Ask: "What is CHIDI?"**

> "CHIDI is a conversational business advisor. Instead of navigating dashboards, you just ask questions — and CHIDI can take action for you."

---

### **When They Ask: "How is this different?"**

> "Most tools put dashboards first, chat second. CHIDI inverts that — everything happens in conversation. You never break flow."

---

### **When They Ask: "What can it do?"**

> "Right now: inventory management, order tracking, sales summaries — all inline. Soon: customer messages, analytics, team collaboration."

**Don't overwhelm. Focus on current value.**

---

### **When They Ask: "Is this AI?"**

> "CHIDI uses AI to understand your questions and surface insights. But it's not just a chatbot — it's an operator. It takes actions, not just answers."

---

### **When They Ask: "What about [complex feature]?"**

> "We're starting with the daily essentials. The foundation is conversation, not features. Once this works perfectly, everything else builds on it."

**Keep it focused.**
